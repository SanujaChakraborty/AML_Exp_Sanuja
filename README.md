There are 15 experiments present here with documentation for Advance Machine Learning.
Experiment 1 
Understanding the "Mobile Price" dataset by doing feature analysis. Data is available at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification/data 
Experiment 2 
Execute the data preprocessing step on the above dataset: perform outlier and missing data
analysis toward building a refined dataset 
Experiment 3 
Build machine learning model/s to predict the actual price of the new mobile-based on
other given features like RAM, Internal Memory, etc 
Experiment 4 
Calculate the prediction accuracy of the models used in Experiment 3 and do a comparative
analysis among them to identify the best technique. 
Experiment 5
Understanding the "Second Hand Car Prediction Price" dataset by doing feature analysis. Data
is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/second-hand-car-priceprediction
Experiment 6 
Perform data preprocessing step on the above dataset: perform outlier and missing data
analysis towards building a refined dataset. 
Experiment 7
Perform feature engineering to build a new feature that is more impactful.
Build machine learning model/s to predict the price of the car based on other given
features like Brand, Model, Year, Fuel Type, etc
Experiment 8 
Calculate the prediction accuracy of the models used in Experiment 7 and do a comparative
analysis among them to identify the best technique. 
Experiment 9 
Plot the features (actual price and predicted price) in a scatter plot to understand the
variation. 
Experiment 10
Understanding the "Marketing Campaign Positive Response Prediction" dataset by analyzing
all the features. Data is available at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/marketing-campaign-positiveresponse-prediction
Experiment 11
Perform exploratory data analysis on the above dataset: Perform outlier and missing data
analysis to build a refined dataset. Show the outliers in a box plot or through some
statistical technique. Find the numerical and categorial features.
Experiment 12
Perform feature engineering to build new features that are more impactful than
the existing ones. Build the correlation matrix and show visually the relationship among
various features.
Experiment 13 
Build machine learning model/s to predict the result of a marketing campaign based on
other given features like customer details, gender, annual income, etc 
Experiment 14 
Calculate the prediction accuracy of the models used in Experiment 13 and doa  comparative
analysis among them to identify the best technique. 
Experiment 15 
Please check whether you find imbalanced classes, overfitting, and data bias in the above
two datasets. Please apply some techniques to overcome it.
